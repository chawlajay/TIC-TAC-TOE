# TIC-TAC-TOE
## This is my first project in c language.
I have made this using three functions.
1. add() function -> stores the used places/cells using arrays. 
2. check() function -> checks that whether the place in grid is already used or not. 
3. win() function -> checks all the possibilities for a player to win and returns the player who wins.
