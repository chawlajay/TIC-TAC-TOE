# TIC-TAC-TOE
This is my first project in c language.
I have made this using three function.
1st is add() function which registers the used places using arrays. 
2nd is check() function which checks that whether the place in grid is already used or Not. 
3rd is win() function which check all the possibilities for a player to win and returns the player info. who wins.
